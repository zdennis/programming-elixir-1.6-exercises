Which of the following will match?

* `[a, b, a] = [1,2,3]` will not match because "3" does not match the value bound to "a" which will be "1"
* `[a, b, a] = [1,1,3]` will not match because "3" does not match the value bound to "a" which will be "1"
* `[a, b, a] = [1,2,1]` will match because the third element on the right, "1", will match what is bound to "a"
